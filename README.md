# STEAM: Pattern Recognition and Illusion

Exploration of the human brain's capability for pattern recognition via a Rubin
vase, Canada, freaky dot patterns, Moire patterns, a Shepard tone,
speech-to-song illusion experiments, and culminating in the construction of a
hollow face dragon/dinosaur.

## Equipment

* Rubin vase image.
* Flag of Canada image.
* Random dot pattern image (at 100% and 95%) and transparency.
  ([A4](scatter_a4.png), [US Letter](scatter_us_letter.png))
* Square Moire pattern image and transparency.

* Triangle Moire pattern image and transparency.

* Computer with audio playback, recording, and editing software (e.g.
  [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/))
* 10-second Shepard Tone. ([WAV](rising_shepard_tone_10_sec.wav))
* Animated optical illusions. Download from brusspup YouTube links.
* Many copies of hollow face t-rex image, or similar. Download from brusspup 
  Youtube links.
* Tape.
* Scissors.

## Post Mortem

This activity went over really well with US third graders (8 years of age). The
parents in attendance enjoyed it, too. There was some difficulty with assembly
of the hollow face t-rex, but with enough adults to help out, it can be done.
