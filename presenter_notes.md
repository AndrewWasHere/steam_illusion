# Pattern Recognition and Illusion

Today I want to talk about pattern recognition and illusion.

Your brain is a marvelous pattern recognition machine. Unlike computers, it 
can easily recognize shapes, colors, sounds, smells. And it's always learning.

It's very hard for a computer to recognize things. Currently, the best way to
get a computer to recognize things is to imitate a human brain. That's what
the latest researchers have been doing to make advances.

The down side (or the cool side) to your brain always learning and looking for 
patterns is it can get fooled.

* Show rubin vase image.

What is this a picture of?

Can anyone see anything else? (two faces)

* Show Canadian flag.

What is this a picture of?

Can anyone see anything else? Hint: It's like the previous picture. The two
faces on the Canadian flag are often referred to as Jack and Jacques, and
represent the combining of two cultures -- English and French -- to form the
country.

Faces are very important to human brains, so it's very good at finding them.

Illusion isn't only in still images.

* Show scatter plots.

Here I've got two copies a random distribution of dots. If I lay one on top of
the other you can see they line up.

What do you see if I rotate the top sheet just a little bit? (Circles)
Your brain is picking out regular patterns made from the two sets of random 
dots.

And what happens to those circles when I move the top sheet up and down? (the
circles move left and right).

And if I move the sheet to the left and right? (the circles move up and down).

If I shrink one of the images just a little bit, you no longer get circles.
You get a spiral -- another regular pattern your brain has trained itself to
see.

Let's go to the opposite end of the spectrum.

* Show square moire.

Here are two copies of a regular square lattice. If I rotate the one on top,
something interesting happens. (square diagonal pattern appears and shrinks
as you turn).

This is called a moire pattern.

If I continue to turn the top sheet, the pattern reappears, and then diverges.

You can do this with different patterns.

* Show triangle moire.

This is a lattice of equilateral triangles. If I rotate the top sheet, you get
black walls dividing white triangles. If I continue rotating the top sheet,
what comes back is not what went out. Some people see hexagons, but those
hexagons are made up of white walls around black triangles. The dual of what
went out.

If I continue to rotate the top sheet, we get back what just went away -- 
white walls against black triangles. These eventually go out, and what comes
back is what we had originally -- black walls dividing white triangles.

If you take the idea of the moire pattern -- images interacting with each other
to create new things, you can do some amazing things.

* Show animations.

Illusions aren't just visual.

* Play Shepard tone loop with shell script.

Most of you heard a continually rising tone. But it isn't. I was playing
a 10 second sample on loop.

Here, I'll show you.

* Play in Audacity.

Pattern recognition can have some interesting effects. Diana Deutsche at UCSD
found a remarkable illusion involving speech. To demonstrate, I will need the
help of your teacher.

I want you to read a sentance from one of the driest sources possible -- a
technical journal -- while I record you.

* Record teacher in Audacity. Play back for class.

Now, I'm going to select a phrase from the recording, and loop it. I want you
to listen to it.

* Play selection.

What happened to the selection? (It started to sound musical).

The clever thing is, your brain has learned to recognise that phrase as music,
even if you hear it as part of the original sentence.

* Play back whole recording.

This takes us to my favorite illusion.

* Take out hollow-face dragon.

What do you notice about this dragon? (It's face is hollow)

Because of this, as you move around the dragon, it will appear to always be
looking at you. Your brain recognizes the object has a face, and will
'autocorrect' so the head looks correct. But since the angles are wrong,
the head appears to follow you when you move.

This illusion doesn't work so well when you're close to the dragon because
you have stereo vision, and your depth perception counteracts the illusion.
So when you're close, like on a small object like this one, close or cover
one eye and you'll see it.

Now, who would like to make their own dragon?

* Build dragon.
